  <div id="causal-blocks-world" markdown="1">
  I am researching probabilistic generative causal models to encode formal representations of robot knowledge and world uncertainties, built from domain expertise and learned from data, for robot sensors, actuators, tasks, and decision-making processes. I am investigating the use of causal Bayesian inference for prediction, planning and decision-making, and causal explanations for robots operating in challenging complex, uncertain, and partially-observable real-world environments. I am exploring the benefits of applying these models and inference methods to achieve the autonomy assurance for robots undertaking tasks in manipulation, assistive robotics, and mine survey applications.
